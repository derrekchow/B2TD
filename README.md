- Setting light patterns
- Saving and switching between light states
- Changing light appearance and control based on conditions, events, and/or an animation timeline
- Controlling lights through: 
  - MIDI controllers
  - Abelton Live
  - Audio or visual cues
- Connecting projector visuals to light parameters and vice versa
